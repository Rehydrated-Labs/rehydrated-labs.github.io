# Hunnibees

**Hunnibees** are NPC mobs included in the [Quicksand Core]({% link pages/quicksand-core.md %}) companion mod that players can trade with. They take the form of anthropomorphic bees.

## Behaviors

Hunnibees are neutral, Hoglin-like NPCs that live in beehives. It randomly wanders about, and won't attack the player unless provoked. When provoked, it will attempt to drag the player into honey.

It barters with flowers, and gives honey-related items back to the player in return.
