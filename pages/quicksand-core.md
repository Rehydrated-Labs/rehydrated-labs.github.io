# Quicksand Core

Quicksand Core is a companion mod to [Quicksand Rehydrated]({% link pages/quicksand-rehydrated.md %}) that is developed with the aim of being more modpack- and vanilla-friendly than the main mod. This includes terrain-themed hazards & structures and [Hunnibees](hunnibees.md), a bee-like NPC that players can trade with.
