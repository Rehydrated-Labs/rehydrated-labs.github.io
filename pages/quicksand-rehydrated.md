# Quicksand Rehydrated

**Quicksand Rehydrated** (**QSR**) is an upcoming Minecraft mod that adds quicksand and other hazards into the game. It is heavily inspired by the *More Fun Quicksand Mod* for Minecraft version 1.7.10. QSR is planned to come with a number of companion mods (such as [Quicksand Core]({% link pages/quicksand-core.md %})) to make it more friendly for modpack use and to cater to a variety of playstyles.
